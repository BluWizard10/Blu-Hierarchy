# v1.0.0
- Now going 1.0!
- Re-designed icons for VRC Constraint Components for visual clarity and to better differentiate between Unity vs VRC Constraints. The other ones were kind of messy to begin with...

# v0.7.0
- Added Icons for the new VRC Constraint Components.

# v0.6.1
- Added Icons for the new Unity Layers exposed by the latest VRChat SDK.

# v0.6.0
- Added the `GameObject -> Copy Path` option to test the usage of copying the Hierarchy path of a GameObject to the clipboard.

# v0.5.0
- Slightly widened all custom Component Icons for display clarity.
- Changed Udon Behaviour Component icon to something that I think looked better when representing either an Udon Graph or an UdonSharp Component.
- Added icon for the `VRCHeadChop` Component introduced in SDK 3.5.2.

# v0.4.2
- Added isPlaying check to prevent icons and GUI changes from loading while in Play Mode. This should optimize performance.

- Fixed a bug where the Layer Icons would never load when Unity is relaunched. It is refreshing the Icons with the most dirtiest method I could think of.

# v0.4.0
- Added Icons for VRChat-specific Layers that is appended next to the Component Icons. It is Off by default.
    - Enable this feature by Toggling On `Show Layer Icon` under `Tools -> BluWizard LABS -> BluHierarchy Settings` in Unity.
    - *Icon will only show if the GameObject is on a specific Layer other than the Default Layer.*
