# BluWizard's Enhanced Hierarchy System

My own personal editor enhancement system that introduces an improved Hierarchy look, tailored made for VRChat Creators. Contains a feature that allows toggling a GameObject or Component directly from the Hierarchy, as well as customized Icons representing common VRC SDK Components in the Hierarchy.

Compared to other systems, this one is intended to match the Editor UI without being too distracting. Less is more, is how I would best put it.
